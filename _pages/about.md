Hey, thanks for stopping by! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer at [Daikin](https://www.daikin-solutions.com/home) with 3.5 year of total experience developing apps.

My passion for data and AI led me to earn a Master’s in Data Science from [University of Malaya](https://https://www.um.edu.my/), with research focused on applying large language models to financial sentiment analysis and stock prediction. I hold a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu.my/) and previously interned as an AI Engineer at [Smartpeep](https://www.smartpeep.ai/).

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly badminton and basketball), reading and traveling with friends and family. Also, I grew up in Malaysia and do speak English, Mandarin, and Malay.
